            Welcome to the Department of Computer Science at George Mason University!

        </h1>
        <p class="intro">
            With nearly 80 full-time faculty members, the CS Department at Mason is the largest department in the College of Engineering and Computing, one of the largest departments on campus, and the largest, fastest growing, and highest ranked Computer Science department in the Commonwealth of Virginia.Today, not only is computing pervasive in society, but computational methods are used in almost every field of scholarly endeavor ranging from the arts and humanities to the hard sciences and engineering, as well as every sector of industry. Given the importance of computing in today's world, we strongly support the goal of "Computing for All", providing a diverse array of programs and courses in computing to students from all backgrounds and at all levels.

            <br><br>

            The department offers two Bachelor of Science programs  with a total enrollment of over 2200 students:  the B.S. in Computer Science and the inter-disciplinary B.S. in Applied Computer Science; four M.S. programs in Computer Science, Information Systems, Information Security and Assurance, and Software Engineering with a total enrollment of almost 1000 students; and a Ph.D. program in Computer Science with nearly 200 students. The department's faculty also teach and participate in the inter-disciplinary M.S. in Data Analytics Engineering and the Ph.D. in Information Technology offered by the Volgenau School of Engineering.
            
            <br><br>

            The department has an active External Advisory Board consisting of industry leaders—many of whom are Mason alumni—who help the department build strong ties with alumni, local industry, government agencies, and local K-12 schools. The Board members also provide the department with critical guidance and feedback so that our courses and programs reflect the state of the art in computing technology, thereby helping us with our goal of graduating students that are well prepared to meet the workforce needs of the Commonwealth and the nation.
